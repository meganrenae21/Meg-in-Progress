<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org87af876">

<b><b>Saturday, August 22, 2020</b></b>
</p>

<p>
In my <a href="blogging-with-org-mode.html">last post</a>, I went over how I set up this blog solely in org-mode. And since that post has been published, I've made a few more changes to the configuration and so, in an effort to provide the most up to date information, I figured I'd write a little addendum. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org106086c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org106086c">Comments</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org106086c">
<p>
I wanted to add a comments section to entries. I really didn't want to put much effort into this&#x2026;just a simple box to respond to posts. It turned out that <a href="http://utteranc.es">utterances</a> provided me with something that was easy to set up and visually appealing. The only issue is that in order to comment, you have to be signed in to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>. Since my site is hosted on github pages, though, this seems like an okay compromise.
</p>

<p>
I chose utterances because each comment section will be self-hosted on this site's repo, it was simple to set up, and while people have to log in to leave comments, I preferred that to allowing "guest" comments. Since internet comment sections have a reputation for being toxic hell-scapes, I wanted to ensure commenters have a stake in what they say. As much as I am an advocate for free speech, I don't want to provide a platform where people are enabled to evade responsibility for what they say. 
-<b>- mode: org; -</b>-
Facebook comments was out because I am not going to force people to use their real names to comment. Disqus would be the obvious choice, or any number of third-party systems. I wasn't inclined to go down that road, mostly because of privacy issues. I don't want data gathered from user comments on my site to be sold by a third party to advertisers. If I expect commenters on my posts to take responsibility for their words, I have a responsibility to ensure an open discussion forum doesn't turn into a for-profit opportunity for anonymous corporations. 
</p>

<p>
It was incredibly easy to set up. All it involved was to install the utterances app on my blog repo, then paste a code snippet to my post template. If you'll recall, I am using YASnippet as a templating tool for my blog posts. That said, I didn't add the code directly into my post snippet. Instead I added a new directory, <code>~/org/src/</code> where I created an <code>utterances.html</code> file with the code in question. Then I simply included the file in my snippet to be exported as html:
</p>

<p>
<code>#+INCLUDE: "../src/utterances.html" export html</code>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb7d55a0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb7d55a0">Templating Update</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb7d55a0">
<p>
Another change I made I started to touch on in my last post, and that has to do with my yasnippet "snippets". I mentioned that including actual code within my ya-snippet file created an issue if I were to make changes to my blog template after the fact. Because of this, I decided to completely revamp my post snippet so that the build of each post is made mostly from external files. Here's an example of what I'm talking about:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-html">#+SETUPFILE: ../org-templates/level-1.org
#+INCLUDE: "./src/header.html" export html

#+TITLE: ${1:Title}
#+CATEGORY: ${2:Category}
#+DATE: `(current-time-string)`
#+FILENAME: ${3:filename}

=* $1=

#+INCLUDE: "../../content/$3.org"

#+INCLUDE: "../src/utterances.html" export html
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that, in addition to the <code>SETUPFILE</code>, I have added three different <code>INCLUDE</code> files to export as blocks. 
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><code>header.html</code></dt><dd>previously this was part of an export block included directly in the snippet. The code hasn't changed; it's just housed elsewhere.</dd>
<dt><code>/content/</code> directory</dt><dd>this was the solution to my date problem that I mentioned in my previous entry. Basically, posts should be dated according to when they were published, not when I started writing them. One solution would be to use the org exporter's <code>{{{DATE}}}</code> macro, which assigns a date when the file is exported, but I wanted to ensure the date wouldn't change if I needed to republish a file for any reason. So, I decided the best thing to do would be to house the actual blog content in a separate file, to be included in the post file, so the date would only be calculated when the snippet was inserted into the post. The idea is to only create a post for export when it is ready to be published.</dd>
<dt><code>utterances.html</code></dt><dd>I explained this above.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="orge92296c">To conclude</h3>

<p>
As I said in my <a href="blogging-with-org-mode.html">last post</a>, this blog is, and will continue to be, a work in progress. Still, I probably won't go over every single change or update I make to the configuration and templating system in the future. Instead, I'll focus on figuring out what kind of content to put on here. I'm barely a programmer or developer &#x2013; I would call myself a creative, and the purpose of this blog is to share some of my story and my process with the world. Stay tuned!
