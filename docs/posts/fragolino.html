Fragolino is an Italian sparkling red wine produced in Veneto with Isabella grape, or uva fragola (literally, "strabwerry-grape"). This kind of grape does not belong to the Vitis vinifera family, but to the Vitis labrusca, and it was introduced to fight a plague of a parasite named phylloxera, which was destroying the European grapevine and wine production.
</p>

<p>
This American grapevine was more resistant to the parasites. Venetian winemakers had the idea to make wine directly with this new grape, and this wine was delicious. Sweet and refreshing, the fragolino is a summer wine, with a delicate aftertaste of strawberry. Fragolino, as fargola means strawberry. Moreover, it was inexpensive and became popular in the Venetian area, where it was produced. However, Fragolino is considered a very low quality wine among connoisseurs. Today, it is almost impossible to find the real fragolino because its commerce was banned by the EU and the Italian government. Many stories have been told about the fragolino ban. The more official is that t was banned because it is difficult to control methanol levels during wine production and methanol can be poisonous.
</p>

<p>
Some science revisionists argue that the Vitis labrusca was actually responsible, due to its resistance, to the spread of the phylloxera plague in Europe, and it was banned for the reason, but this confusing version of the story ignores the historical fact of its importation in Europe, France first, was made in the 19th century for the exact oppposite reason, when the phylloxera was already destroying the Vitis vinifera cultivations.
