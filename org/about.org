* About Me

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you - Nobody - too?
Then there's a pair of us!
Don't tell! they'd advertise - you know!

How dreary - to be - Somebody!
How public - like a Frog -
To tell one's name - the livelong June -
To an admiring Bog!
#+END_VERSE
/Emily Dickinson, 1981/

I'm Meg, a work in progress.
